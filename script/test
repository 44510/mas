# OBJROOT - Intermediate Build Files Path
# The path where intermediate files will be placed during a build. Intermediate files include generated sources, object
# files, etc. Shell script build phases can place and access files here, as well. Typically this path is not set per
# target, but is set per project or per user. By default, this is set to `$(PROJECT_DIR)/build`.

# SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR - Precompiled Headers Cache Path
# The path where precompiled prefix header files are placed during a build. Defaults to `$(OBJROOT)/SharedPrecompiledHeaders`.
# Using a common location allows precompiled headers to be shared between multiple projects.

# SYMROOT - Build Procucts Path
# The path at which all products will be placed when performing a build. Typically this path is not set per target,
# but is set per-project or per-user. By default, this is set to `$(PROJECT_DIR)/build`.
