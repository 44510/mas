Create a music channel and show your friends and co-workers what you're listening to and see their favorites as well.  \n\nOther solutions like IFTTT poll the Last.fm feed and only update every 15 minutes or so, ChannelScrobbler allows you to choose your update period and see updates as frequently as every 30 seconds.  \n\nChannelScrobbler runs in your status bar and can launch on startup, so it's always there, listing every track you play.  Because ChannelScrobbler reads your Last.fm feed scrobbles from your account it will catch new songs from any device that supports scrobbling, not just your computer!\n\n* Includes retina graphics and support for dark status bars!\n* Scrobbles are posted by a bot with customizable name, avatar, and colors.\n\nIf you're having problems using ChannelScrobbler, please email edelabar@gmail.com for support.",

You will definitely be able to use Ratstash if you have a token (you paste this into the App). Or;\n- Install as an App to your team (https://slack.com/apps/AATHN8U86-ratstashapp). All members except guests are allowed to this. Please check your privileges in your team to confirm.\n\nQuestion: How far back in message history can I export?\nAnswer: It depends.\n- If you're on a free Slack team: Ratstash has the same history limits as what you'd experience using the Slack UI (10k limit). However, once Ratstash retrieves the history, it will be kept forever.\n- If you're on a paid Slack team, you can export all history with Ratstash.",
